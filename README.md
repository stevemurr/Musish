This is my fork of the awesome Musish ([musi.sh](https://musi.sh/)).  I forked it to test some interaction theories on music discovery.

## Quickstart

This repo requires `node` version `14`.  A great way to install & manage node runtimes on linux is [nvm](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvm/).

### Install Packages
`yarn`

### Start dev server
`yarn start`

## Explorations

### Genre Venn Diagram

![](./.docs/genre-venn-diagrams.jpg)

An artist will explore various genre's and techniques over the course of their work.  Does visualizing an artists stylistic footprint through the lens of composition of styles produce novel discovery patterns?

### Timeline discovery

The experience of any art is linked to the time and space you experience it in.  Music is particualarly bound by time as it's quite literally a temporal art form; your experience of music must occur over time.

Timelines are an obvious visualization of information with relation to time.

### Synesthesia

[While listening to music some people simeltanously experience the sensation of color.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia).  Modern software interfaces don't explore cognitive shortcuts through use of color.  Does use of color in the interface improve discovery?
